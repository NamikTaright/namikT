abstract: The sensitivity and specificity of surveillance for Clostridium difficile infections according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, codes were compared with laboratory results as standard. Sensitivity was 35.6%; specificity was 99.9%. Concordance between the 2 methods was moderate. Surveillance based on ICD-10 codes underestimated the rate based on laboratory results.
